I developed a full-stack web application using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MySQL to implement a secure user authentication system. The application features login and registration pages, allowing users to easily sign up and log in through a form. User credentials are securely stored in a MySQL database, with passwords hashed using bcrypt.js for added security. Upon successful login, users are granted access to a protected profile page, as well as a "Gym" and "Finance" page. The sessions of the user are managed using JWT and cookie-parser, ensuring secure and persistent authentication within the browser.

download the folder, then in terminal (on vs code) type npm start.
